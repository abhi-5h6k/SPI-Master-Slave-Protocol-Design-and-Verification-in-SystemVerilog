üîç Objective
The objective of this project is to design and verify a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication system between a Master and a Slave using SystemVerilog. The system facilitates the serial transmission of 12-bit data, emphasizing modular design, FSM-based control, and testbench-based verification.

üß† Introduction to SPI
SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous serial communication protocol used primarily for short-distance communication. It consists of:

Master: Initiates and controls communication.

Slave: Responds to the master‚Äôs command.

Signals:

SCLK: Serial Clock (generated by the Master)

MOSI: Master Out Slave In (data from Master to Slave)

MISO: Master In Slave Out (not used here)

CS: Chip Select (active-low signal to enable Slave)

This project implements only unidirectional communication from Master to Slave (MOSI) for 12-bit data transfers.

‚öôÔ∏è System Design Overview
1. SPI Master
Function: Sends 12-bit data serially to the Slave using MOSI.

Inputs:

clk: System clock

rst: Active-high reset

newd: Trigger signal to start new transmission

din[11:0]: 12-bit input data

Outputs:

sclk: Serial clock (divided from clk)

cs: Active-low chip select

mosi: Serial output data

Features:

FSM-based control (idle, enable, send, comp)

Clock division to generate sclk

LSB-first data transmission

2. SPI Slave
Function: Receives 12-bit data serially from MOSI on sclk edge.

Inputs:

sclk: Serial clock

cs: Chip select

mosi: Serial data

Outputs:

dout[11:0]: 12-bit parallel output

done: Transfer complete flag

Features:

FSM-based control (detect_start, read_data)

Bit-wise shift register to collect data

Generates done when 12 bits are received

3. Top Module
Function: Integrates the SPI Master and Slave modules to create a complete system for simulation and testing.

üß™ Testbench Architecture
A lightweight UVM-inspired architecture is used, composed of the following SystemVerilog classes:

Component	Description
transaction	Encapsulates input (din), output (dout), and control (newd)
generator	Randomizes and generates 12-bit input transactions
driver	Drives input values into the DUT
monitor	Monitors the output from the SPI Slave
scoreboard	Compares expected vs actual data
environment	Connects and orchestrates all verification components

Mechanisms Used:

Mailboxes for inter-component communication

Events for synchronization (e.g., generator waits for scoreboard to complete before sending next data)

üß™ Verification Strategy
20 randomized 12-bit transactions are generated.

The driver activates the newd signal and sends data via Master.

The Slave receives the data through SPI and stores it in dout.

The monitor captures the dout once the done signal is high.

The scoreboard compares the transmitted (din) and received (dout) values.

Pass/Fail results are displayed for each transaction.
